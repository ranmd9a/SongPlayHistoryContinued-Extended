## Notes

- Recording play data begins when you first install this plugin. (This doesn't apply to play counts.)
- The data file (_SongPlayData.json_) is created in Beat Saber's _UserData_ directory. You can delete individual records from there if you want.
- The data are not uploaded anywhere so you have to **backup** the file when re-installing the game.
- If you run into any problem, please contact me either via Discord _(Shadnix#8875)_ or by filing an issue.
